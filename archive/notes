#purpose
  I am very much interested in a clear, easy to use Web. A Web that is a joy to use, that responds quickly to my touch, that gives me clear error messages and most of all, doesn't need a manual because it's just plain obvious how it works. While much of the code I have worked on professionally is proprietary, you will notice a pattern in my sideprojects. They are uncluttered. They are simple to navigate. 

  My source code is clean and uncluttered. 

  Sometimes that means developing JavaScript front ends that can do work without connecting to the server, thus shortening the time before the user sees a change in the page. 

  Another interest is in community projects. Teaming up to solve problems, whether they be technical or human networking or mentoring or whatever.

    Developed in me a desire to separate the programmer "whatever is easiest" from the user/designer "whatever is easiest". Let the designer chart a course that will lower the brain friction. Then go the extra mile to make the software conform to that.
