  .description My role on the Flywheel server team included making portions of the app geo-aware. For example, what fare structures get displayed to a user based on where in the world the Flywheel app is opened. My work also provided the back-end logic for displaying display special alerts when a livery vehicle was substituted for a regular taxi during peak usage times.
