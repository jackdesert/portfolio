  .title= link 'Flywheel App (2013)', flywheel_dot_com
  .description Hail a cab from your smart phone, and watch it drive toward you
  .more My role on the Flywheel server team included making portions of the app geo-aware. For example, what fare structures get displayed to a user based on where in the world the Flywheel app is opened. My work also provided the back-end logic for displaying display special alerts when a livery vehicle was substituted for a regular taxi during peak usage times.

      %li News feed showing what your most recent activity is (like who you approved for a trip, what you signed up for, when you last updated your profile, etc.)
      %li Photos of each user, displayable on the carpooling page, so you can get to know people better that you hiked with
      %li A leader blurb, or philosophy, displayed on each event that leader is associated with. By seeing the leader's name, photo, and philosophy blurb before you even sign up, you have a better sense of whether his/her leadership style will mesh with what you're looking to get out of the adventure
      %li An enhanced ADMIN page, where you can see all leaders in the system, and easily upgrade them to be admins if you like
      %li Carpooling page with entries grouped by whether they are offering or soliciting a ride
      %li Enhanced menus
      %li Clear delineation of who is the registrar for the event. This allows a user to respond to a system email, and it will go to the registrar for the event. Likewise, if a leader or registrar responds to the email that says "so and so signed up", that email goes to the user who signed up.
      %li Code is much easier to maintain, since it's written in Rails
